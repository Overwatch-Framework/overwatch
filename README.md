# Overwatch

Overwatch is a Garry's Mod framework for creating roleplaying servers. It is designed to be lightweight, modular, and easy to use.

### Installation

To install Overwatch, simply clone the repository into your `garrysmod/gamemodes` directory. You can do this by installing GitHub Desktop and cloning the repository.

### Usage

To use Overwatch, you must first create a new schema. A schema is a collection of entities, weapons, and other elements that define the rules of your new gamemode. You can create a new schema by creating a new folder in the same directory where the framework is installed.

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Overwatch, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. We are always looking for new contributors to help improve the framework.
