Physical representation of connected player.

`Player`s are a type of `Entity`. They are a physical representation of a `Character` - and can possess at most one `Character`
object at a time that you can interface with.

See the [Garry's Mod Wiki](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Category:Player) for all other methods that the `Player` class has.
